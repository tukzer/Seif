# Seif
SEIF stands for Starter Enterprise's Internet Framework, it's generally a brief SOA framework(consumer-registry-provider).  
 You can call remote methods like local methods base on that framework.  It's a backbone now, and I'm still working on that.  
 Oh you know, I wanna do something like Dubbo did on .net platform.
